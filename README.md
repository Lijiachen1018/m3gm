# M3GM
This repository is the future home for code for *Max-Margin Markov Graph Models (M3GMs)* as described in the paper:

**October 2: there is code here, it is still untested for many changes, including Python 2->3**

Yuval Pinter and Jacob Eisenstein. Predicting Semantic Relations using Global Graph Properties. EMNLP 2018.
```

In addition, this (or a co-released) repo will feature an exploration Notebook for WordNet (WN) structure, and a mapping of Synset codes from WN 1.6 all the way to 3.0.

Written in August 14, 2018, the expected release date is sometime in October (the conference starts October 31).

If you can't wait until then, hit me up at `uvp@gatech.edu`.
